# win-bluetooth
A set of modern c++ classes for using bluetooth on windows

This library is still a work in progress.

The intent is to create a bluetooth library using Qt and winsock to fill the capability gap in Qt 5.10. Class APIs by design will be similar/identical to their Qt counterparts, and a user familiar with QtBluetooth should be able to use win-bluetooth without (much of) a learning curve.
